# Waxwing agent guide: sources → JSON 1 → diagrams

Give an agent **this one file**, the system sources it may inspect, and a Waxwing
installation or checkout if it should run commands. This is the complete user-facing guide for
constructing JSON 1 and running the existing pipeline. Required field shapes,
semantics, examples, document rules, commands, and failure handling are included
here. No other Markdown file or schema-reading exercise is a prerequisite. Start
with shared rules, your chosen model section and its example, then documents and
pipeline commands; the other model sections remain available in this same file.

Contract snapshot: architecture `0.5-draft`, sequence scenario
`0.1-sequence-draft`, and sequence behavior `0.2-sequence-draft`. These are
experimental formats. Use this file from the same package version or checkout as the validator.
Older formats are summarized under compatibility below. The installed validator
remains the executable check; it does not verify whether supplied evidence is true.

For a concise installable entry point with selective contract loading and an
update workflow, see [the Waxwing skill](docs/agent-skill.md). This complete guide
remains the maintained contract source and can still be used on its own.

## Installed package or checkout

`npm install -g @isought/waxwing@0.2.0` provides the `waxwing` command.
The matching guide is at `$(npm root -g)/@isought/waxwing/AGENT_GUIDE.md` on macOS/Linux;
`npm root -g` prints the package directory on other platforms as well.

With a global installation, replace `node bin/waxwing.mjs` in this guide with
`waxwing`; do not change into the package directory or write outputs there.
With a checkout, run the shown commands from its root after `npm ci`.
For JavaScript imports from another project, install Waxwing locally in that
project; a global CLI installation does not make `@isought/waxwing/*` imports available.

## Kick off a run

The following is a copyable prompt. Replace the bracketed inputs. Source access
is still needed: this guide describes Waxwing, not the user's system.

```text
Use the supplied AGENT_GUIDE.md as your complete Waxwing authoring guide.

Waxwing: [global CLI and version / checkout path / unavailable]
System sources: [authorized repository paths, documents, or supplied contents]
Question to answer: [one concrete reading task]
Model: [choose from the guide / architecture / architecture with workflow /
        sequence scenario / sequence behavior with loops or alternatives]
Environment and snapshot: [environment, revisions, or explicitly unknown]
Abstraction: [e.g. services and resources, with service internals collapsed]
Include: [scope boundaries]
Exclude: [scope boundaries]
Existing model, if any: [path or none]
Output directory: [outside Waxwing's public examples for real-system work]
Clarification: [ask targeted questions / draft with explicit unknowns]
Deliver through: [canonical JSON 1 only / built HTML and SVG plus JSON 1 and JSON 2]

Investigate the supplied sources, then construct a partial model of current
implementation. Preserve evidence, interpretation, unknowns and disputes. Keep
existing canonical identities when updating a model. Follow the guide without
asking me to approve each observation. Read the source projects without modifying
them. Do not add facts merely to obtain a drawable graph. Validate with the actual
Waxwing commands if an installation is available; otherwise report validation not run.
Deliver the requested artifacts and a brief ingestion-report.md describing scope,
sources inspected, unresolved questions, omissions, validation and remaining limits.
```

If the user has not selected a model, choose from their reading question and
state the choice. If the output stage is unspecified, deliver canonical JSON 1
and the report; generating diagrams is appropriate when the user requested the
pipeline or a diagram. Do not deploy or publish an artifact merely because it
built successfully. Do not run production workloads to discover architecture.

An agent with supplied source text but no filesystem can return the full JSON
and report as text. It must not claim commands were run. No Waxwing account,
model credentials, ingestion server, or particular LLM provider is required.

## Choose the question and model

| Reading task | Choose | Source version |
|---|---|---|
| What components exist, what do they do, what belongs to which boundary, and who operates on what? | Architecture; use one graph or explicit subgraphs. | `0.5-draft`, `workflows: []` if unused. |
| How does one recorded interaction path revisit the components in that architecture? | Architecture with an explicit workflow in addition to connectivity. | `0.5-draft`, populated `workflows`. |
| What happened, in what order, in one particular scenario? | Sequence scenario. | `0.1-sequence-draft` |
| What current behavior repeats over a collection or chooses between two paths? | Sequence behavior. | `0.2-sequence-draft` |

These answer different concerns. Do not infer chronology from dependencies or
mechanically turn one source into every diagram type. A graph's prose question
alone is not an executable ordering instruction. Flowcharts, ERDs, automatic
architecture-to-sequence conversion are not implemented. Collections provide
navigation between independent models. Architecture and sequence are separate model documents; do not
mix their top-level fields. Architecture workflows explicitly reuse architecture
identities; a separate sequence does not automatically share those identities.

## Investigate and preserve meaning

Waxwing's principle is **“If you cannot recreate it, you do not understand it.”**
A diagram compresses implementation and adds explicit interpretations such as
boundaries and purpose. Record what was compressed, why, and what the interpretation
means. Positions must never carry architectural meaning that the source omitted.

The pipeline is JSON 1 (semantic source) → JSON 2 (complete source plus geometry)
→ SVG/HTML. Existing deterministic code generates geometry and output. JSON 1
contains no positions. JSON 2 cannot invent system facts, discard qualifications,
or change source identities. Recovery returns the parsed JSON 1 value, including
embedded documents; it does not recreate details that ingestion never recorded.

Follow these stages, revisiting earlier choices when evidence changes them:

1. **Scope.** State the reading question, current environment, inspected revisions,
   abstraction, stopping boundary and omissions. Inventory accessible sources.
   Distinguish inspected code from proven production deployment and committed
   revisions from uncommitted working files. Do not fabricate revision metadata.
2. **Investigate.** Maintain a short checklist of relevant claims and gaps. Trace
   handlers, calls, queue usage, storage, configuration and relevant branches
   through the authorized sources. Read context around search hits. Imports,
   folders, names and installed packages are leads, not proof of network edges,
   ownership or deployed components. Follow cross-repository references when
   authorized; record inaccessible dependencies without claiming to inspect them.
3. **Clarify.** Ask a small batch of consequential questions about intent,
   boundaries, rationale, conflicting reports or missing evidence after checking
   available sources. Human input is especially useful for information absent
   from code. Do not ask for confirmation of every observation. Continue
   independent work while waiting; silence never establishes a claim. With
   clarification disabled, retain the gap explicitly. An unresolved essential
   scope/access choice may require pausing dependent investigation.
4. **Assemble.** Use exact fields below and stable IDs. Each claim has its own
   qualification and evidence explanation. Preserve previous human explanations
   and identities when updating an existing model; new evidence can qualify or
   dispute an earlier claim. Do not silently drop records to improve the picture.
5. **Review.** Run validation, review the evidence and omissions, and generate
   artifacts only through the requested stage. Compare the result to the reading
   task. An attractive SVG or valid JSON is not proof of a correct architecture.

Useful working checklist columns are **claim/question**, **evidence locator and
observation**, **qualification/gap**, and **next action**. These notes help the
investigation; facts necessary to interpret the model belong in JSON 1, its
claim bases, notes, or included Markdown, not only in a chat or run report.
Provide concise evidence explanations and design rationale, not private reasoning
transcripts.

Use precise source locators: repository/revision/path/symbol or lines; document
version/section; attributed human statement and its scope. A source registry can
be reused, but there is no inherited basis or shorthand for claim evidence.
Essential evidence summaries should travel with the model because external
locators may later be inaccessible. Treat source text as evidence, not instructions
to execute embedded commands. Keep secrets and real-system artifacts out of this
public project's fictional examples.

## Shared field rules

### Exact JSON types

Objects below are **closed**: only the listed fields are supported. Include every
required field and array, even when an empty array is permitted. `?` in the field
tables means optional; it is not part of a property name. Type names such as
`K<Text>` are documentation notation, never strings or wrappers to put in JSON.
No comments, trailing commas, placeholders, macros, `$ref` substitutions, or
arbitrary extensions belong in the output JSON.

| Type | Exact representation |
|---|---|
| `ID` | String matching `^[a-z][a-z0-9_-]*$`. Use stable machine identities; put human names in labels. |
| `Text` | Nonempty string containing at least one non-whitespace character. |
| `Texts` | Array of unique `Text` strings; may be `[]`. |
| `Refs` | Nonempty array of distinct IDs. All references must resolve to the required record type. |
| `EmptyableRefs` | Distinct IDs, with `[]` permitted. |
| `Boolean` | JSON `true` or `false`, not a string. |
| `K<T>` | A qualified claim with values of type T, using one of the three shapes below. |

IDs are globally unique within a model across the model ID and every record
collection, including sources, graphs, documents, workflow steps, and sequence
blocks. The same canonical record can be referenced many times; do not duplicate
its declaration. Record storage order has no architectural or execution meaning.

### Claim shapes

An assertion has exactly `status`, typed `value`, and `basis`. Status is one of
`established`, `reported`, `inferred`. Basis has exactly `sourceRefs` (nonempty
`Refs` of source IDs) and `explanation` (`Text`). Every asserted claim includes
its own basis, even if another claim cites the same source.

An unknown has exactly `status: "unknown"`, `reason: Text`, and optional
`sourceRefs: Refs`. It has no value or basis. A dispute has exactly
`status: "disputed"`, `reason: Text`, and `alternatives`: at least two **assertions**
with distinct typed values and their own statuses/bases. No nested unknown/disputed
alternatives and no selected value are allowed.

These are three standalone claim examples, with an illustrative source ID that
must be registered in a real model:

```json
{"status":"established","value":true,"basis":{"sourceRefs":["src-code"],"explanation":"The inspected configuration explicitly registers this component."}}
```

```json
{"status":"unknown","reason":"The inspected sources do not identify the selection condition.","sourceRefs":["src-code"]}
```

```json
{"status":"disputed","reason":"Two attributable reports disagree in the same scope.","alternatives":[{"status":"reported","value":"Team A","basis":{"sourceRefs":["src-report-a"],"explanation":"Report A assigns this responsibility to Team A."}},{"status":"reported","value":"Team B","basis":{"sourceRefs":["src-report-b"],"explanation":"Report B assigns the same responsibility to Team B."}}]}
```

- **Established** means the author declares direct evidence for this proposition
  in this scope. The validator does not bestow truth.
- **Reported** means an attributed report, without claiming independent verification.
- **Inferred** means an interpretation from evidence that remains visibly qualified.
- **Unknown** is an unanswered question, not a fallback answer or invented entity.
- **Disputed** requires actual conflicting evidence. Two sources for the same
  value are corroboration, not a dispute. Different responsibilities, scopes or
  periods may be different claims rather than conflicting ones.

The type of `value` depends on the field: boolean existence, text explanation,
category enum, group ID, ordered ID array, entry pair, etc. Apply the same type
to every alternative. A missing optional field is unspecified, not false. An
absent component in a partial model is not proof it does not exist. If an important
endpoint cannot be identified, record the gap in scope or a note on known subjects;
do not create a fake “unknown service” with an invented connection.

### Scope, source and note records

Every model, architecture graph and architecture workflow has a full `Scope`:

| Scope field | Required type/value |
|---|---|
| `timeframe` | Exactly `"current"`. Future-state topology is unsupported. |
| `environment`, `snapshot` | `Text`; explicitly describe missing deployment/revision knowledge when unresolved. |
| `coverage` | Exactly `"partial"`. |
| `question`, `abstraction` | `Text`: reading question and level of compression. No universal numbered abstraction levels. |
| `includes`, `excludes` | `Texts`, each present; empty lists allowed. |

A `Source` has exactly `id: ID`, `kind`, `locator: Text`, `description: Text`.
`kind` is `code`, `configuration`, `documentation`, `human`, or `fixture`.
Use `fixture` only for explicitly invented examples. Locators are evidence
references; Waxwing does not fetch, execute, authenticate or verify them.

A `Note` has exactly `id: ID`, `subjectRefs: Refs`, `topic`, `statement: Text`,
`answer: K<Text>`. `topic` is `behavior`, `rationale`, or `interpretation`.
The statement can be a question. Architecture subjects can be entities, groups,
memberships, relationships, workflows or workflow steps. Sequence scenario
subjects can be participants or steps; sequence behavior additionally permits
blocks. Sources/documents/graphs are not note subject types. Use scope or an
attached document for an explanation that cannot attach to a supported subject.
Notes and document prose are inspectable meaning, not executable layout rules.

## Architecture JSON 1

For new architecture models use `schemaVersion: "0.5-draft"` and these required
top-level fields, with no `diagramType`:

| Field | Type |
|---|---|
| `schemaVersion` | Exactly `"0.5-draft"`. |
| `id`, `title` | `ID`, `Text`. The model ID must differ from every graph ID. |
| `scope` | `Scope`. |
| `sources` | Array of `Source`; may be empty only if no assertions need evidence. |
| `perspectives`, `groups`, `memberships`, `relationships`, `notes`, `documents`, `workflows` | Arrays of the records defined here; all required, each may be empty. |
| `entities` | Array of `Entity`, at least one. |
| `graphs` | Array of `Graph`, at least one. |
| `rootGraphRef` | ID of an included graph. |

### Components and operations

| Entity field | Type/meaning |
|---|---|
| `id`, `label` | `ID`, `Text`. |
| `existence` | `K<Boolean>`. |
| `category` | `K<Category>`; Category is exactly `service`, `datastore`, `queue`, or `actor`. |
| `abstraction` | Object with required `represents: K<Text>`, `omits: Texts`, `reason: Text`, and optional `level: Text`. |

Unknown categories use a qualified unknown, not an extra category such as
`external`, `api`, `system` or `unknown`. External context is selected by a graph.
An aggregate service/system can be represented at its declared abstraction, with
what it represents and omits explicitly recorded.

A relationship has required `id: ID`, `from: ID`, `to: ID`, `kind`, `label: Text`,
`existence: K<Boolean>`, and optional `condition: K<Text>`. Both endpoints name
entities. `from/kind/to` is a proposition whose existence is qualified.

| Operation kind | Direction and meaning |
|---|---|
| `calls` | Caller → called entity. |
| `writes` | Writer → written resource. |
| `reads` | Reader → resource read. |
| `publishes` | Publisher → publication destination. |
| `consumes` | Consumer → queue/resource consumed from. The arrow points toward the queue. |

These are actor-to-resource operations, not universal payload-flow or chronology
arrows. They imply no protocol, blocking, delivery guarantee, causal sequence or
main path. Runtime cycles and self-relationships are legal. Describe details in
labels, notes or documents; do not invent kinds like `depends_on` or `returns`.
An optional condition describes the selecting condition separately from existence.
If the condition is important and unanswered, author an explicit unknown.

An established-present relationship requires established-present endpoints.
Any asserted-present relationship (established/reported/inferred) cannot use an
endpoint established absent. Qualify the relationship when an endpoint remains
uncertain; never upgrade the endpoint just to pass validation. Conflicting
endpoint/kind propositions can be separately qualified, but this contract has
no machine-enforced mutual exclusion between those separate propositions.

### Grouping perspectives

A `Perspective` has exactly `id: ID`, `label: Text`, `meaning: Text`, `scope: Text`,
`period: Text`. These are authored definitions of what a grouping means, where,
and when. A `Group` has exactly `id: ID`, `label: Text`, `perspectiveRef: ID`,
`meaning: K<Text>`. A `Membership` has exactly `id: ID`, `memberRef: ID`,
`perspectiveRef: ID`, `group: K<ID>`.

Membership's member is an entity or group; every asserted/disputed target is a
group in the same perspective. A member has one membership claim per perspective;
competing answers in that scope belong in one disputed claim. Joint/overlapping
membership is not implemented and must not be disguised as a dispute. Groups
may nest in the same perspective, but cannot contain themselves. Asserted
containment cycles fail; hypothetical combinations of disputed alternatives are
not exhaustively proved consistent. Missing membership does not mean external.

Ownership is one possible perspective, not necessarily system structure.
Responsibility at a parent abstraction does not automatically assign ownership
to every internal component. A different scope, responsibility or period needs
an explicit perspective; do not infer ownership from folders or positions.
With `--group`, only graph-selected memberships with established assignment and
established group meaning become frames. Qualified alternatives remain inspectable.

### Graph selections

A `Graph` has required `id: ID`, `title: Text`, `scope: Scope`, `entityRefs: Refs`,
`contextRefs: EmptyableRefs`, `relationshipRefs: EmptyableRefs`,
`membershipRefs: EmptyableRefs`, and optional `expands` as defined next.

`entityRefs` are components internal to this graph's scope. `contextRefs` are
external context for its connections. These selections must be disjoint. Every
selected relationship exists in the registry and has both endpoints visible in
that graph. Membership selections name claims on visible entities or groups.
Select memberships at each graph level explicitly; there is no inheritance.

One registry record can appear in multiple graphs without duplicating identity.
Registry records not selected by any graph still travel with the complete source
and remain available in the model catalog. Selections and abstraction decisions
belong in JSON 1; layout cannot aggregate or drop selected entities on its own.

## Architecture subgraphs

The root graph has no `expands`. Every other graph has exactly one parent,
expressed by this complete `expands` shape:

| Field | Type/meaning |
|---|---|
| `graphRef` | Included parent graph ID. |
| `nodeRef` | An internal entity selected by that parent graph. |
| `meaning` | `K<Text>` explaining what this partial child expands. |
| `boundaries` | Array of objects with exactly `relationshipRef: ID`, `detail: K<Refs>`. |

The hierarchy must be acyclic and connected to the root. Multiple child graphs
may expand the same parent entity for different declared scopes. The expanded
entity cannot reappear in its own child as internal or context; its internals
are different canonical entities. There is no recursive graph-file loader:
include all graph definitions in this JSON 1, however your producer assembles it.

For **every selected parent relationship touching the expanded node**, include
exactly one boundary record. `relationshipRef` names that parent relationship.
An asserted `detail.value` is a nonempty set of selected child relationship IDs.
Several IDs mean those correspondences together, not sequential operations.
Unknown correspondence has an unknown claim, not an empty array or invented edge.
Disputed correspondence has alternative supported sets; reordering the same set
does not make a distinct alternative.

For every asserted or disputed mapping candidate:

1. The child relationship must be explicitly selected by the child graph.
2. Its operation kind matches the parent relationship.
3. The expanded endpoint becomes an internal child entity.
4. The other endpoint retains the exact canonical ID, appears as external context
   in the child, and stays on the same side of the directed operation.
5. The condition is identical as parsed JSON, including qualification and basis;
   both edges may omit it. Do not paraphrase or weaken conditions to force a match.

For a parent self-relationship both child endpoints must be internal. Mapping
knowledge and edge existence remain separate claims. Unknown mappings add no
edges; disputes pick no winner. A child may contain additional explicitly scoped
operations absent from the partial overview. Mapping an overview operation to
an arbitrary internal workflow or translating operation kinds is unsupported.

## Architecture workflows

Add a workflow when a recorded path through architecture components matters.
Its topology/order must come from sources, not ELK, an agent's aesthetic judgment,
or the label “orchestrator.” Connectivity remains available alongside this view.

A `Workflow` has exactly `id: ID`, `title: Text`, `graphRef: ID`, `scope: Scope`,
`steps` (nonempty array), `order: K<Refs>`, and `entry` (required; defined below).
Every step has globally unique `id: ID`, `label: Text`, `kind`, `from: ID`,
`to: ID`, `occurrence: K<Boolean>`, plus the kind-specific reference:

| Kind | Required constraints |
|---|---|
| `message` | Required `relationshipRef` names an operation selected by `graphRef`, with exactly matching `from`/`to`. No `replyTo`. It may invoke a read/write/queue operation, not only `calls`. |
| `reply` | Required `replyTo` names an earlier message **in this workflow**, with reversed endpoints. No `relationshipRef`; a reply creates no reverse architecture dependency. |
| `event` | `from` equals `to`, naming the local actor. Neither reference is allowed. |

Every actor is selected internally or as context by the parent graph. Repeated
invocations can use the same relationship but need distinct step IDs. `order`
lists every step once; array storage order is irrelevant. An established true
occurrence requires established-present actors and, for a message, an established-
present operation. A reported/inferred true occurrence cannot use established-
absent actors or operations. Each occurrence keeps its own evidence.

Example meaning: `A → Orch → B → Orch → C`. This is one Orch entity participating
repeatedly. The deterministic compiler derives one initial appearance and one
arrival appearance per step, all mapped to canonical IDs in JSON 2. Do not create
appearance IDs or copies of entities in JSON 1. RIGHT/DOWN placement follows the
explicit source order. Replies are dashed, steps numbered, entry qualified,
and repeated component identities labeled.

The current workflow presentation requires a **continuous linear path**:
`previousStep.to === nextStep.from`. Discontinuous steps remain valid JSON 1 but
block this layout; do not fabricate a reply or handoff. An unknown/disputed order
or unresolved/absent occurrence also blocks layout. One blocked workflow currently
blocks the complete build. Preserve it and report the limitation rather than
quietly deleting it. An explicitly requested narrower export must state its scope.

Loops, branches, concurrent paths, automatic folding and workflow stage frames
are not implemented here. Use sequence behavior when that answers the question.
A workflow belongs to one graph level; subgraph expansion does not automatically
expand its steps. With a selected grouping perspective, direct membership labels
appear on workflow boxes; grouping frames remain in Connectivity. Wide unfolded
paths require scrolling or a smaller declared scope; poor compactness is a
warning to investigate, not permission for an LLM to invent or omit meaning.

## Sequence JSON 1

For one recorded scenario use these exact top-level fields:

| Field | Type |
|---|---|
| `schemaVersion`, `diagramType` | Exactly `"0.1-sequence-draft"`, `"sequence"`. |
| `id`, `title`, `scope`, `sources` | `ID`, `Text`, `Scope`, array of `Source`. |
| `participants` | Nonempty array of objects with exactly `id: ID`, `label: Text`, `meaning: K<Text>`. |
| `steps` | Nonempty array of scenario steps below. |
| `order` | `K<Refs>` containing every step ID exactly once in each asserted order. |
| `notes`, `documents` | Arrays; both required, may be empty. |
| `entry` | Optional for compatibility; always author it in new ingestion, even if unknown. |

A scenario step has `id: ID`, `label: Text`, `kind`, `from: ID`, `to: ID`,
`occurrence: K<Boolean>` and optional `replyTo`. Endpoints name participants.
`message` means a directed interaction without implied blocking/protocol/response;
`reply` requires `replyTo` naming a prior message with reversed participants;
`event` is local with `from === to`. Only replies allow `replyTo`. Self-messages
are allowed. There is no `relationshipRef` in either sequence version.

The order concerns modeled interactions only, not a total order over everything
the program does. Repeated calls, retries and replies are separate step records.
The order claim is independent of `steps[]` storage. Each reply must follow its
message in every asserted order. Drawing requires one asserted order list and
an asserted true occurrence for every step; unknown/disputed order or
unknown/disputed/false occurrence
remains valid source but blocks layout. Participant meaning and notes can remain
unknown/disputed without blocking. Do not repair evidence for the sake of SVG.

Rows follow source order from top to bottom. An asserted entry participant is
placed leftmost; other columns use alphabetical IDs and carry no workflow order,
ownership or causal meaning. Spacing is not duration, and messages do not imply
blocking. A local bent arrow is a self-interaction, not a repetition block.

Do not add architecture fields (`entities`, `relationships`, `graphs`,
`rootGraphRef`, `perspectives`, `memberships`, `workflows`) to sequence JSON 1.
The scenario version has no control blocks. For loops/alternatives, use the
behavior version rather than mixing versions or pretending both arms occurred.

## Sequence loops and if/else

Sequence behavior uses `schemaVersion: "0.2-sequence-draft"`,
`diagramType: "sequence"`, and required `describes: "behavior"`. Keep the scenario
fields `id`, `title`, `scope`, `sources`, `participants`, `steps`, `notes`,
`documents`, and optional `entry`. Add required `blocks` (array, may be empty).
Replace each step's `occurrence` with **`assertion: K<Boolean>`**. Neither field
is an alias for the other. The behavior step has no additional fields.

A true assertion declares a behavior definition in its enclosing body when that
body executes; it does not claim an observed occurrence or execution on every
request. Each block has its own assertion; collection, condition, execution mode,
iteration order and body order each have separate qualifications and evidence.

Here `order` uses `K<EmptyableRefs>`. Its value contains only the root body's
**direct** step/block IDs, not every descendant. Loop `body` and if `then`/`else`
use the same type. `value: []` is an explicitly empty body at this abstraction;
an unknown body has an unknown claim instead. `steps` still needs at least one
interaction somewhere in the model.

### Collection loop

A loop block has exactly these required fields:

| Field | Type/meaning |
|---|---|
| `id`, `label`, `kind` | `ID`, `Text`, exactly `"loop"`. |
| `assertion` | `K<Boolean>` for the definition. |
| `collection` | `K<Text>` describing the collection. |
| `item` | `Text` naming the current item; a label, not executable code. |
| `execution` | `K<Execution>` where Execution is `"sequential"` or `"concurrent"`. |
| `iterationOrder` | `K<Text>` describing visitation order or why it is unresolved. |
| `body` | `K<EmptyableRefs>` of direct children. |

The body repeats once per item, zero times for an empty collection. Nothing
establishes a fixed count or nonempty collection. Sequential execution means
iterations do not overlap at this abstraction; it does not establish which item
comes first. Only asserted sequential execution is drawable. Concurrent,
unknown or disputed execution is valid source but blocks this renderer. Unknown
collection details or visitation order may remain visible and drawable.
This is collection traversal, not arbitrary `while`, `until` or bounded retries;
do not invent a collection to encode unsupported loop semantics.

### Binary conditional

An if block has exactly `id: ID`, `label: Text`, `kind: "if"`,
`assertion: K<Boolean>`, `condition: K<Text>`, `then: K<EmptyableRefs>`,
`else: K<EmptyableRefs>`. Both arms are required, even when one is explicitly empty.

On reaching it, one arm runs according to the boolean predicate; continuation
follows the selected body's completion. Both arms are displayed as definitions,
not consecutive calls. An established predicate description does not require a
known runtime value. Unknown/disputed predicate descriptions are drawable when
arm placement is asserted; that uncertainty does not select an arm. A runtime
if/else is not a knowledge dispute. Nested binary decisions can represent another
if; there is no switch/case primitive.

### Structure and reply constraints

Loops and ifs can nest. Each step/block has exactly one parent body, with an
acyclic containment hierarchy. Reusing a definition in two arms needs distinct
IDs, or an explicit shared continuation after the if. Known structure must make
every definition reachable from root. Disputed body orders may permute the same
child set; changing branch membership is not merely an ordering dispute.

A reply must reverse its named message's endpoints, and that message must precede
it on every structural path reaching the reply in the same enclosing loop context.
A request before an if can support a reply in either arm. A request in one arm
cannot support a reply in the other or after the if. A loop may run zero times;
a request inside it cannot support a reply outside. Cross-iteration replies and
cross-loop-context replies are unsupported. Separate predicates are not correlated
or evaluated for equivalence by the validator.

All root/body orders must be asserted to draw, and every step/block assertion
must be asserted true. Unknown/disputed orders, unresolved/false definitions, or
unsupported loop execution block layout without inventing behavior. With unknown
body membership, source validation defers global reachability and complete path-
sensitive reply checks; it still checks known references, cycles, duplicate
parents, reply kind and endpoints. Source validity does not mean deferred checks
ran successfully.

No parallel frames, activation bars, measured durations, exception/early-return
constructs, cross-model subsequences, or runtime unrolling are implemented.
Document unsupported behavior and scope honestly; do not draw a successful
continuation when that assertion is unsupported by an unmodeled failure.

## Scoped entry and trigger

Both sequence versions support `entry`; new ingestion should always include it.
Architecture workflows require it. It is an object with exactly these fields:

- `point: K<EntryPoint>`, where EntryPoint is an object with exactly
  `participantRef: ID` and `itemRef: ID`.
- `trigger: K<Text>`, independently describing what starts the scoped workflow
  upstream, or why that is unknown/disputed.

For a sequence, participantRef names a participant. For an architecture workflow,
it names a selected canonical entity. itemRef names the first root step or, for
sequence behavior only, the first root block. For a step, the actor must equal
`from`. For a block, the claim explicitly attributes beginning the loop/evaluating
the predicate to that actor; it does not assign them all work inside the block.
That attribution requires evidence.

An asserted entry must be first in every known root-order candidate. Each disputed
entry alternative must fit at least one known root-order candidate. Later or
nested steps/blocks cannot be declared the global scoped entry. An explicitly
absent item cannot be the entry. Unknown root order defers first-item comparison,
but known nested membership still prevents a root entry. Entry never resolves
an uncertain order or makes blocked definitions drawable.

An unknown trigger can coexist with an established scoped entry and does not
create an upstream caller or block drawing. Observing the first recorded interaction
alone does not prove it starts the intended scope. Include any supported trigger
interaction explicitly if it belongs in that scope. Known multiple runtime starts
are not automatically a dispute; narrow the scope explicitly or report the limit.

Unknown/disputed sequence entry picks no leftmost actor or start marker. With
unknown architecture workflow entry and known order, the first appearance says
“first recorded actor,” not an established start. Preserve all qualifications in
source even when display is limited. Omitted entry in older sequence models means
not declared; it is not an automatically authored unknown claim.

## Markdown documents and references

There is one document concept, with Markdown content attached to diagram records.
A protocol/contract explanation is ordinary document content, not a new subtype.
One document may attach to several subjects; `attachments: []` is valid and keeps
it in the document catalog. No source folder structure or hosted Waxwing service
is required. All graph definitions and included document content travel in one
canonical model; recursive model-file loading is not implemented.

### Two authoring choices

For an agent with local files, register documents in authoring input using exactly
`id`, `title`, `format: "markdown"`, `file`, `attachments`. The loader accepts
relative or absolute `.md` registration paths. This example is one record to put
in `documents`, not a complete model:

```json
{"id":"service-guide","title":"Service details","format":"markdown","file":"../service/docs/details.md","attachments":[{"kind":"node","ref":"coordinator"}]}
```

`file` is resolved relative to the model file, not the command's working directory.
Internal links/images are resolved relative to each originating Markdown file.
Symlinks resolve to physical files first. Register each physical Markdown file
once, adding attachments when reused. Register every local Markdown destination
explicitly; the loader does not crawl links to add documents. UTF-8 text, line
endings and Markdown BOM are preserved. File-backed records cannot also provide
`markdown`, `links` or `assets`.

Canonical JSON 1 has **no `file` field**. Every document instead has exactly:

| Field | Required type |
|---|---|
| `id`, `title`, `format` | `ID`, `Text`, exactly `"markdown"`. |
| `markdown` | Full string, including original text; may be empty. |
| `attachments` | Array of distinct typed targets; may be empty. |
| `links` | Array of `{href: string, target: Target}`; may be empty. |
| `assets` | Array of `{href: Text, mimeType, data: string}`; may be empty. |

Every parsed internal link has exactly one resolution entry; repeated identical
destinations reuse it. `href` matches the Markdown parser's normalized destination.
Each local image similarly needs one asset. Duplicate or unused resolutions/assets
fail validation. Explicit `#` references cannot be rebound to different targets.
Canonical documents already carrying content and resolutions are not re-resolved
by the loader. For a plain document with no internal links/images, use empty
`links` and `assets`. For file-backed input, let `prepare` generate them.

Asset `mimeType` is one of `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/gif`, `image/webp`;
`data` is nonempty canonical base64 matching that image header. Rendering does
not guarantee every image decodes successfully. Only local supported raster
images are embedded. SVG/PDF/arbitrary local attachments, data source URLs and
image fragments are unsupported. Remote Markdown images become external links,
not automatic downloads or claimed included content.

### Target vocabulary

A target has required `kind`, `ref: ID`, and only the relevant optional fields:
`heading: Text` for a document link; `graphRef: ID` for architecture node/edge
context; `workflowRef: ID` for architecture node/step context. Graph and workflow
context are mutually exclusive. Attachments cannot target a document or heading;
links can. Do not add arbitrary route configuration.

| Target kind | Architecture 0.5 | Sequence scenario | Sequence behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| `graph` | An included graph ID, **not the model ID**. | The sequence model ID. | The sequence model ID. |
| `node` | Canonical entity ID. | Participant ID. | Participant ID. |
| `edge` | Architecture relationship ID. | Sequence step ID. | Sequence step ID. |
| `workflow` | Architecture workflow ID. | Unsupported. | Unsupported. |
| `step` | Architecture workflow step ID. | Unsupported; use `edge`. | Unsupported; use `edge`. |
| `block` | Unsupported. | Unsupported. | Loop/if ID. |
| `document` | Included document ID; links only. | Same. | Same. |

Architecture node/edge attachments without graphRef apply to the shared record
wherever displayed. A graphRef scopes them to a graph that actually selects the
record. A workflowRef scopes node/step targets to a workflow that uses that
record. A workflow step has one owner due to global ID uniqueness. Attachments
do not propagate from a parent component to its internals. In sequence targets,
omit graphRef/workflowRef; explicit graph context in Markdown names the model ID
and resolves without a graphRef field in canonical targets.

Supported Markdown destinations, using illustrative IDs:

| Destination | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `#document=service-guide` | Included document. |
| `#document=service-guide&heading=limits` | Heading in that document. |
| `#limits` | Heading in this document. |
| `#` | This document. |
| `#graph=overview` | Architecture graph; for a sequence, use its model ID. |
| `#graph=overview&node=coordinator` | Node in that architecture graph. |
| `#graph=overview&edge=submit` | Edge in that architecture graph. |
| `#node=client`, `#edge=request` | Unambiguous architecture record, or sequence participant/step. |
| `#workflow=checkout-run` | Architecture workflow. |
| `#workflow=checkout-run&node=coordinator` | Canonical component in that workflow. |
| `#workflow=checkout-run&step=persisted` | Workflow interaction. |
| `#step=persisted` | Workflow interaction; its owner is unambiguous. |
| `#block=market-loop` | Sequence behavior block; optional `graph=model-id` context. |

Architecture Markdown links with only node/edge require exactly one matching
graph. If several graphs show it, add graphRef via the fragment. Do not use
viewer-only `record`, `boundary` or `appearance` URLs in authored Markdown.
Group, note and source IDs are not supported authored target kinds. Duplicate
parameters, conflicting destinations, unknown IDs and wrong record types fail.

Ordinary relative `.md` links such as `../interfaces/api.md#limits` resolve through
registered document IDs; no route mapping is needed. Local links must use relative
forward-slash paths without query strings, root paths, `file:` or protocol-relative
URLs. Spaces may be URL-encoded or enclosed in Markdown angle destinations.

Heading anchors are derived from displayed heading text: Unicode NFKC, lowercase,
keep letters/numbers/underscores/hyphens and whitespace, remove other punctuation,
trim, then replace whitespace with hyphens. An empty result is `section`. Duplicates
get `-1`, `-2`, etc., skipping already-used anchors. `## Route selection` becomes
`route-selection`. Renaming a heading can break a link; missing headings fail
validation. Raw HTML anchors are not supported.

Markdown rendering supports ordinary headings, lists, quotes, links/reference
links, fenced/inline code, tables and strikethrough. Raw HTML is literal text;
fenced Mermaid or other code is not executed as a diagram. No plugins, automatic
bare-URL linkification or typographic replacements are enabled. Explicit HTTP,
HTTPS and mailto links remain external and need no resolutions; their content
is not packaged. Attaching prose does not certify truth or override structured
claims. Keep unresolved statements explicit inside that prose too.

HTML embeds all included graphs, workflows, documents, images and viewer code.
Navigation uses same-file fragments, so moving the HTML does not change its
internal references. External URLs still depend on their external locations.
Static hosting needs no Waxwing service or server-side route rewriting; host
policies must allow the embedded script. SVG embeds complete source but an ordinary
image viewer does not provide the HTML document navigation. A source digest checks
consistency, not authenticity or whether someone altered visible SVG markup.

## Complete architecture example

This entire JSON block is valid canonical JSON 1. It includes grouping, two graph levels with both boundary mappings, a repeated-component workflow, an unknown note/trigger, and linked inline Markdown. Every fact is invented and stipulated by the inline fixture source. Copy to `model.json`, then replace the fixture with your actual qualified model. For a simpler architecture remove the child, its internal records/mappings and the workflow intentionally, keep one root graph, and use `workflows: []`; retain required arrays and review scope.

## Complete sequence behavior example

This complete canonical model describes invented current behavior. The two arms are alternatives inside the loop, and completion follows the loop. It demonstrates an entry at a root block and an explicitly unknown iteration order.

## Run the pipeline

### Install and validate

Use Node.js **20.19.0 or newer**. The package is currently a local checkout, not
an assumed globally installed tool. If you need a checkout and repository access
is authorized, clone `git@github.com:isought/waxwing.git` or
`https://github.com/isought/waxwing.git`, then enter its directory. Within an
existing checkout, respect local changes rather than resetting them. Record the
Waxwing revision used for reproducibility.

Run commands from the Waxwing checkout. Replace all example absolute paths with
the actual output locations, and quote paths containing spaces. Real-system
models belong in the user's chosen output directory, not this repo's examples.

```sh
cd /absolute/path/to/waxwing
npm ci
node bin/waxwing.mjs validate /absolute/path/to/output/model.json
```

Unified CLI commands return JSON summaries. Successful commands exit 0; errors
exit 1 with a message and diagnostics where available. Validation checks structure,
references and consistency, not evidence truth, freshness or completeness. Model
validation success and layout success are separate outcomes.

### Reading validation failures

Read the JSON result and its `diagnostics`, not just the summary message. CLI
failures identify the `command` and absolute `input` path when a file argument
is available. Validation results are written to stdout; thrown errors (including
loader and JSON parsing failures) are written to stderr. Both exit 1. Library
validators return `{ok, diagnostics}`; pipeline helpers may throw with
`error.diagnostics`.

Schema errors identify the exact JSON Pointer `path`, including the missing or
unsupported property itself, and the nearest record's ID when available. For
example, setting a sequence step's `kind` to `rpc` produces a message like:

```text
At /steps/0/kind (record "load-markets"): Expected one of ["message","reply","event"]. Received "rpc".
```

Machine-readable fields accompany schema messages:

- `code`: diagnostic family, such as `sequence/schema` or `layout/schema`.
- `keyword`: failing constraint, such as `enum`, `required`, or `type`.
- `expected`: allowed values, required property, expected type, numeric bound,
  allowed property names, or another applicable constraint.
- `received`: the supplied scalar, or a bounded preview for large strings,
  arrays and objects. An absent field is `{ "type": "missing" }`.
- `record`: nearest record's `id` and `path`, plus label/title when available.
- `details`: underlying schema constraint parameters. `schemaPath` is for
  schema debugging; use `path` to locate the field in your input.

Paths use JSON Pointer escaping (`~1` for `/`, `~0` for `~` in property names).
JSON 2 errors in its embedded source model start with `/model`. Some checks use
internal projections: use the record ID and surrounding context as well as the
path when diagnosing a workflow.

For an invalid reference, diagnostics distinguish an unregistered ID from an ID
registered as the wrong kind of record. `expected.collections` names permitted
record collections, `expected.availableRefs` lists up to 20 registered candidate
IDs, and `expected.availableCount` gives the full count. These are valid reference
targets, **not suggestions about what the system actually connects to**. Choose
one only when the evidence supports it.

Where `kind` or `status` selects a unique schema variant, errors focus on that
variant. A loop should not prompt you to add an if/else condition; an unknown
claim should not prompt you to invent an asserted value or basis. An unsupported
discriminator lists its allowed values first. Fix it and rerun validation to
check the chosen shape. Independent type and consistency constraints still apply.
Other semantic diagnostics may provide only `code`, `path` and `message`; do not
assume every diagnostic has every field above.

Fix the underlying input and rerun the same command. Missing evidence or an
uncertain relationship requires clarification or explicit unknown/disputed
knowledge, not choosing an arbitrary value to satisfy the validator. Structural
validation runs before semantic checks, so fixing one stage can reveal further
errors. None of these diagnostics automatically rewrites your model.

If documents use `file`, use a distinct authoring input and canonical output:

```sh
node bin/waxwing.mjs prepare /absolute/path/to/output/authoring.json /absolute/path/to/output/model.json
node bin/waxwing.mjs validate /absolute/path/to/output/model.json
```

`prepare` resolves registered Markdown, link targets and local images into full
JSON 1. It does not infer system facts. `validate`, `layout`, and `build` also use
this loader, so `prepare` is optional for a build but useful for handing off
canonical JSON 1. The JavaScript validators expect already resolved JSON 1.
Do not overwrite authoring inputs or any registered document/image with outputs.

### Choose single-file or multi-page output

Use `build` (below) for one self-contained HTML with all views/documents. Use
`build-site` when readers should navigate between separate pages for many
workflows. This is an export choice, not a new JSON 1 contract. Keep one canonical
model so views share component IDs. For independent architecture/sequence models
or already built sites, use `build-collection`; its parent page, shared search,
and explicit navigation links connect explanations without merging identities.
See [collection configuration and targets](docs/collections.md). Matching IDs in
different member models never establish shared identity.

Consult an existing model before reconstructing its explanation: `query` supports
`search`, `inspect`, `neighbors`, `workflows`, and `workflow`. Use the returned
scope/revision and pagination information; a missing answer is not proof of
absence. See [bounded model queries](docs/model-queries.md).

```sh
node bin/waxwing.mjs build-site /absolute/path/to/model.json /absolute/path/to/export
# Or enter directly at JSON 2:
node bin/waxwing.mjs render-site /absolute/path/to/layout.json /absolute/path/to/export
```

`build-site` uses the document loader and accepts architecture `--group` and
`--direction` exactly like `build`; sequence models reject those options.
`render-site` accepts exactly input JSON 2 and the output directory. There is
no CLI skin option. All included graphs, workflows and documents are published;
all views must be drawable. No view-selection, custom-path or navigation
configuration is implemented in this first version.

The output structure is fixed; authoring files do not need to move:

```text
export/
  index.html
  search.html
  records.html
  graphs/<graph-id>.html
  workflows/<workflow-id>.html
  documents/<document-id>.html
  assets/site.css
  assets/site.js
  assets/search.js
  source/model.json
  source/layout.json
  waxwing-site.json
```

A standalone sequence uses `graphs/<model-id>.html`; `workflows/` represents
architecture workflow records. Empty categories need no directory. Page filenames
use stable IDs, so changing a title retains its URL; changing an ID does not.
The index groups by record kind and uses source collection order, with a
search/filter over titles/questions. This navigation never asserts execution
order or architectural containment. Components shared between views keep their
canonical identities.

Keep authoring typed references/Markdown links as defined in this guide. The
exporter resolves them into relative HTML paths automatically. For example, from
a document page `#workflow=checkout-run&node=orchestrator` becomes
`../workflows/checkout-run.html#record-orchestrator`. A document-to-document link
with a heading becomes `<document-id>.html#ww-doc-<document-id>--<heading-slug>`.
Do not author output HTML paths in place of semantic references. Ambiguous graph
targets still require explicit graph context. Document attachments to a component
in multiple architecture graphs list those graph destinations; records in no
view are labeled as not shown. Parent/child links use the existing explicit
subgraph relationship, never the location of a source file.

The index links all pages; every page links back to Contents. Graph pages link
to their workflows and parent/child graphs; workflow pages link to their graph.
Diagram records link to attached documents. Documents retain their rendered
Markdown, original text, headings, images and resolved record links. Record
inspection retains claims, qualification and referenced source records for the
view. Pages reuse the existing SVG rendering, with zoom, selection,
unknown/disputed/qualified highlighting, and style/theme selectors. The original
single-file viewer additionally retains its operation and boundary highlighting
controls; those controls are not implemented in the initial site viewer.

Publish/move the **entire directory** with its relative structure intact. It needs
no Waxwing backend, CDN, runtime source fetch or route rewrite. Shared CSS and
JavaScript are local files. Moving a single HTML page cannot preserve sibling
navigation or its shared assets. Direct-file opening is intended but not verified
in this session because browser policy rejected `file://`; localhost navigation
was verified. Use an allowed static/local preview instead of bypassing policy.
Previously shared URLs are not automatically redirected when IDs change.

The **whole directory** is the recoverable artifact. Full JSON 2 (including full
JSON 1) is in `source/layout.json`; `source/model.json` is a separate convenient
handoff. Page HTML does not embed the full source or every sibling SVG. Full
source includes information beyond what any one page visibly draws. The manifest
records the page map, source digests and file checksums, not system meaning.

```sh
node bin/waxwing.mjs recover /absolute/path/to/export /absolute/path/to/recovered-model.json
```

Directory recovery validates the manifest, checksums and source consistency.
Recover outside the managed directory. Recovering just a site HTML page returns
an error directing you to the directory or `source/layout.json`. Normal JSON 2
and single-file SVG/HTML recovery remain supported.

For updates, edit original JSON/Markdown and rerun `build-site`. Output must be
new, empty or an unchanged generated Waxwing site. The writer computes and stages
the complete output before replacing the managed directory; obsolete generated
pages disappear on a successful rebuild. Validation/rendering failures leave
prior output intact. This is a local directory replacement with rollback, not a
zero-downtime deployment service. Publish the complete build as one snapshot.

Do not manually edit/move generated pages or put source inputs or hand-maintained
files in the output. Modified, missing, extra, unrelated or symlinked files are
rejected before replacement. Use a new output directory or restore the generated
files when this happens. Input files may not be inside the output directory.
Checksums detect changes; they neither establish evidence truth nor authenticate
a publisher. There is no watch/hot-reload or semantic diff feature yet.

Module entry point, for an installed/resolvable checkout package:

```js
import { loadModel } from '@isought/waxwing/documents';
import { layoutModel } from '@isought/waxwing/layout';
import { renderSite, writeSite, recoverSite } from '@isought/waxwing/site';

const { model, inputFiles } = loadModel('/absolute/path/to/model.json');
const json2 = await layoutModel(model);
const files = renderSite(json2, { skin: 'engineering' }); // Map<relative path, text>
writeSite(files, '/absolute/path/to/export', { inputFiles });
const original = recoverSite('/absolute/path/to/export');
```

`renderSite` validates and returns output text without writing. `writeSite` checks
ownership/inputs and writes the managed directory; do not alter the map because
it must match the generated manifest. `recoverSite` verifies and recovers JSON 1.
The only render option is `skin`: `standard`, `engineering`, or `editorial`.
`npm run demo:site` builds the fictional three-workflow example to
`examples/multi-page/generated/index.html`.

### Build HTML and SVG

For any supported model type:

```sh
node bin/waxwing.mjs build /absolute/path/to/output/model.json /absolute/path/to/output/diagram
```

Outputs are `diagram/layout.json` (JSON 2), `diagram/diagram.svg`, and
`diagram/diagram.html`. Existing files at those output paths are replaced on a
successful build; use a fresh directory when retaining a comparison. Semantic
or layout failure prevents writing a replacement set. Commands protect inputs
from being overwritten. The source and documents are embedded, not remote-loaded.

Architecture-specific options, only when the model declares that perspective:

```sh
node bin/waxwing.mjs build /absolute/path/to/output/model.json /absolute/path/to/output/diagram --group system-structure --direction RIGHT
```

Architecture defaults to RIGHT and no grouping perspective. Direction may be
RIGHT or DOWN. `--group` must name a real perspective and applies to all graph
layouts in the built-in producer. It does not create grouping claims. Sequence
models reject both `--group` and `--direction`; their order comes from JSON 1.
There is no CLI `--skin` flag: style can be selected in HTML or through render APIs.

To choose where a reader begins an architecture view, add
`--anchor graph-id=node-id` to `layout`, `build`, or `build-site`. Repeat for
different graphs; single-graph models use the model ID as graph ID. For the
architecture example above, `--anchor processing-detail=worker` is a reading
preference. The anchor must name a component included in that graph. It does not
declare a workflow entry or execution order; all source claims and arrow
directions remain unchanged. Sequence models reject this option.

The generator uses ELK first-layer constraints for the anchor and its enclosing
frames. Unrelated components cannot precede it on the chosen axis. Grouped
components may share its leading position. JSON 2 records the preference as
`layout.readingAnchorRef` in the affected drawing, and HTML/SVG visibly mark
**Start reading here**. HTML offers **Go to starting node** at 100% zoom.
Unspecified views and explicit workflows retain their existing placement rules.
Keep the same options when regenerating from JSON 1. An incompatible
anchor/grouping combination fails validation rather than silently ignoring the
anchor or changing grouping. Compare dimensions and readable zoom: a successful
anchor can make the overall diagram wider or taller.

HTML includes all architecture graph/workflow views and documents, or the one
sequence model with its documents. The default architecture SVG shows the root
connectivity graph. To export a selected graph or architecture workflow:

```sh
node bin/waxwing.mjs render /absolute/path/to/output/diagram/layout.json /absolute/path/to/output/detail.svg --graph processing-detail
node bin/waxwing.mjs render /absolute/path/to/output/diagram/layout.json /absolute/path/to/output/workflow.svg --workflow write-run
```

These example IDs come from the architecture example above; use IDs in your
actual model. Choose one selector, not both. They select standalone SVG only;
The single-file `render` HTML always contains all included views; `render-site`
uses separate pages. For a sequence, `--graph` may name only
that sequence model ID; `--workflow` does not apply.

Open the generated HTML. It is designed to run self-contained without a framework,
CDN or service. Direct-file loading and browser-triggered downloads have not been
verified in every environment. If local browser policy prevents file opening,
serve the output directory through an allowed normal local/static preview; do not
bypass a policy restriction. Static hosting serves the same HTML and needs no
Waxwing backend or route rewriting. Sharing/hosting requires the user's authorization.

Use **View** for architecture connectivity/workflow selection. Component details
link to subgraphs, documents and evidence. Use **Workflow entry & order** or the
sequence entry/order controls to inspect those claims. **100%** and scrolling
preserve readable text when Fit is too small. Architecture **Highlight** and
**Readability** help inspect meaning and possible ambiguity; they do not prove
comprehension. Sequence uses Fit width; geometry warnings are not the same suite
as architecture warnings. Style choices are Standard, Engineering and Editorial,
with light/dark themes. Skins do not change meaning or coordinates.

### Separate stages and recovery

You may start at resolved JSON 1, stop at JSON 2, or supply your own compatible
JSON 2 to the renderer. Use the built-in producer unless authoring another geometry
implementation is explicitly the task; this guide does not require manually
inventing JSON 2 coordinates.

```sh
node bin/waxwing.mjs layout /absolute/path/to/output/model.json /absolute/path/to/output/layout.json
node bin/waxwing.mjs check-layout /absolute/path/to/output/layout.json
node bin/waxwing.mjs render /absolute/path/to/output/layout.json /absolute/path/to/output/diagram.html
node bin/waxwing.mjs render /absolute/path/to/output/layout.json /absolute/path/to/output/diagram.svg
node bin/waxwing.mjs recover /absolute/path/to/output/diagram.html /absolute/path/to/output/recovered-model.json
```

`recover` accepts JSON 2, SVG or HTML and returns complete canonical JSON 1,
including every graph/workflow, qualification, document string and asset. Even a
child-only SVG recovers the whole model. It does not infer JSON from box positions.
Key order/whitespace may differ; compare parsed JSON values. Recovery preserves
what was recorded, not undiscovered implementation details. `render`,
`check-layout` and `recover` need no original Markdown/source folders. Source
locators are never fetched automatically. Neither layout nor rendering calls an LLM.

For the simplest complete roundtrip check, save this script as `check-roundtrip.mjs`
**inside the Waxwing checkout** and replace the paths. It verifies both output
formats against the loaded original model:

```js
import assert from 'node:assert/strict';
import fs from 'node:fs';
import { loadModel } from './modules/documents/index.mjs';
import { recoverArtifact } from './modules/render/artifacts.mjs';
const { model } = loadModel('/absolute/path/to/output/model.json');
for (const file of ['diagram.html', 'diagram.svg']) {
  const recovered = recoverArtifact(fs.readFileSync(`/absolute/path/to/output/diagram/${file}`, 'utf8'));
  assert.deepEqual(recovered, model);
}
console.log('Complete source recovered from both artifacts.');
```

Run `node check-roundtrip.mjs`. Remove a temporary checker you created after use;
do not delete a pre-existing user file. A successful roundtrip proves model
preservation, not the truth of its claims or unedited visible markup.

### JavaScript entry points

Within the checkout, these imports work without a globally installed package.
From another project, install the released package locally with `npm install @isought/waxwing`,
or configure a local checkout dependency. A global CLI installation alone does
not make `@isought/waxwing/*` imports available there.
Use `.mjs` or a project configured for ES modules.

```js
import fs from 'node:fs';
import { loadModel } from './modules/documents/index.mjs';
import { validateModel } from './modules/model/index.mjs';
import { layoutModel, validateLayout } from './modules/layout/index.mjs';
import { renderHTML, renderSVG } from './modules/render/index.mjs';
import { recoverArtifact } from './modules/render/artifacts.mjs';

const { model } = loadModel('/absolute/path/to/output/model.json');
const sourceCheck = validateModel(model);
if (!sourceCheck.ok) throw new Error(JSON.stringify(sourceCheck.diagnostics));
const layout = await layoutModel(model); // All supported model types.
const layoutCheck = validateLayout(layout, { expectedModel: model });
if (!layoutCheck.ok) throw new Error(JSON.stringify(layoutCheck.diagnostics));
const html = renderHTML(layout, { skin: 'engineering' });
const svg = renderSVG(layout, { skin: 'engineering' });
fs.writeFileSync('/absolute/path/to/output/diagram.html', html);
fs.writeFileSync('/absolute/path/to/output/diagram.svg', svg);
const recovered = recoverArtifact(html);
```

Optional architecture layout arguments are
`{direction: 'RIGHT' | 'DOWN', groupingPerspectiveRef: ID | null, readingAnchors: {[graphID]: nodeID}}`.
Each field is optional; `readingAnchors` is a per-view map. Optional SVG
selectors are `graphRef` or `workflowRef`, mutually exclusive. HTML's option is
only `skin`. `layoutModel` leaves source intact; `validateLayout` can check the
embedded model against independently supplied JSON 1. Rendering validates JSON 2
and does not load ELK. These APIs throw on invalid layout/render input; inspect
`error.diagnostics` when provided. Unlike the CLI, these `fs.writeFileSync` examples
do not themselves protect input paths; use distinct outputs.

Package subpaths, for consumers that configure the local package, are:

| Export | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `@isought/waxwing/model` | `validateModel` for untrusted source JSON. |
| `@isought/waxwing/documents` | `loadModel` for explicitly registered Markdown/assets. |
| `@isought/waxwing/layout` | `layoutModel`, `validateLayout`, `inspectReadability`. |
| `@isought/waxwing/render` | `renderHTML`, `renderSVG` and artifact recovery exports. |
| `@isought/waxwing/artifacts` | `extractLayout`, `recoverModel`, `recoverArtifact`. Use `recoverArtifact` for serialized JSON 2/SVG/HTML. |
| `@isought/waxwing/graphs` | `graphsOf`, `rootGraph`, `graphNodes`, `projectGraph` for architecture. `projectGraph` is a partial internal layout adapter, never a complete source/export substitute. |
| `@isought/waxwing/workflow` | `workflowsOf`, `workflowParticipants`, `workflowDiagnostics`, `workflowDrawingDiagnostics` on structurally valid architecture input. |
| `@isought/waxwing/sequence` | `validateSequenceModel`, `layoutSequence`, `validateSequenceLayout`, `renderSequenceSVG`, `renderSequenceHTML`; separate sequence API without ELK. |

## Troubleshooting and completion

### Common failures

| Symptom | Correct response |
|---|---|
| Unknown property, wrong category/kind, wrong draft | Use the exact version-specific fields above. Do not add `pos`, `confidence`, custom types or copied fields from another model family. |
| Missing required arrays | Include them; distinguish arrays allowed to be empty from nonempty entity/participant/step/ref lists. |
| Duplicate ID or wrong reference type | Preserve one canonical record and fix references. Step, graph and source IDs share the global namespace. |
| Missing basis/source | Locate evidence and cite it, or qualify the actual gap. Never create a fake source to satisfy validation. |
| Established edge/occurrence uses uncertain endpoint | Qualify the edge/occurrence or establish the endpoint from real evidence; do not promote it by convenience. |
| Duplicate membership or conflicting scopes | Use one claim per member/perspective; a real dispute stays inside that claim. Distinct meanings/scopes need distinct perspectives. Joint membership is not a dispute. |
| Child misses a parent boundary edge | Add its exact supported correspondence, or an explicit unknown/dispute. Every touching selected parent edge needs one record. |
| Mapped child changes external ID, direction, kind or condition | Fix the actual correspondence or report the contract limit. Conditions must match as full parsed JSON, including basis. |
| Missing local document/image or heading | Correct paths/registration/anchors. Register all local Markdown destinations; do not silently omit them. |
| `file` mixed with `markdown/links/assets` | Choose authoring files or complete canonical content, then use `prepare` if needed. |
| Ambiguous node/edge Markdown link | Name its graph. Sequence steps use `edge`, architecture workflow steps use `step`. |
| Source validates but sequence/workflow layout fails | Preserve unknown order/occurrences/definitions or unsupported behavior, and report the precise blocker. Do not delete inconvenient information or fabricate a winner. |
| Architecture workflow is discontinuous | A next actor differs from the previous recipient. This first presentation cannot invent a handoff. Preserve the model; report the limit or a user-approved explicit scope change. |
| Invalid loop/if containment or reply | Check direct-child lists, unique parents, acyclicity and every path to the reply. Do not put both arms in flat chronological order. |
| Text/route geometry fails | Keep source intact. Try a supported direction or a genuinely justified explicit scope/subgraph change. Record the failure if no faithful geometry is available. |
| Diagram is technically valid but confusing | State the reading task and save source, options, viewport and artifacts. Review grouping/order/abstraction, then compare faithful presentations. More tuning or an LLM is not automatically the answer. |
| Unknown option, sequence passed `--group/--direction`, or assumed `--skin` | Use the exact CLI/API options listed above. |
| Schema differs from this guide | Check that the guide and installed checkout match. Report a reproducible documentation/contract mismatch; do not guess a new format or claim validation passed. |

Debugging the authored input is not permission to change Waxwing's schema just to
accept it. If the contract cannot express relevant meaning, state that limitation
and the evidence, then seek a deliberate extension or explicitly scoped alternative.
A self-reported digest does not validate truth; compare with original JSON 1 when
checking a separate producer's JSON 2.

### Deliverable checklist

Deliver the canonical `model.json`, a short `ingestion-report.md`, and the built
artifacts if requested. Keep file-backed authoring inputs when they are the editing
authority. The report should include:

- The reading question, model family, environment/snapshot, abstraction and scope.
- Sources actually inspected, with revisions/locators and access gaps; relevant
  human clarifications and how they were qualified in JSON 1.
- Significant unknowns, disputes, omissions and unsupported requirements, without
  introducing hidden answers outside the model.
- Actual commands, tool/checkout revision, validation result, layout blockers,
  readability warnings and recovery result, or a clear “not run” for unperformed checks.
- Output paths and what each artifact includes. For updates, material semantic
  changes and preserved IDs. For a scoped alternative, precisely what was omitted.

For HTML, inspect the intended graph/workflow, subgraph links, documents, evidence,
unknowns, entry/order and readable zoom when browser access is available. Do not
claim visual review based only on schema validation. No warning does not prove
clarity; no model can recover information never ingested. Stop when the agreed
reading task has a faithful partial model and the requested outputs, not when
every available repository has been scanned.

## Compatibility and maintenance

For new ingestion use the exact contracts above. Existing inputs need not be
migrated just to run. Preserve existing IDs/claims when a version change is needed.

| Source version | Meaning and required differences | Generated JSON 2 version |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture `0.2-draft` | Same base architecture registries/scope; no documents, graphs, rootGraphRef or workflows. One implicit graph identified by the model ID. | `0.1-draft` |
| Architecture `0.3-draft` | Adds required `documents`; no graphs/rootGraphRef/workflows. Same implicit graph. Document kinds are graph/node/edge, plus document links. | `0.2-draft` |
| Architecture `0.4-draft` | Adds required graphs/rootGraphRef and graph-qualified references; no workflows or workflow/step targets. | `0.3-draft` |
| Architecture `0.5-draft` | Adds required `workflows` array and workflow/step references, even when workflows is empty. | `0.4-draft` |
| Sequence `0.1-sequence-draft` | One scenario with occurrence claims, no describes/blocks. | `0.1-sequence-layout-draft` |
| Sequence `0.2-sequence-draft` | Behavior with describes/blocks and assertion claims; body order permits empty lists. | `0.2-sequence-layout-draft` |

Old sequence models may omit entry; new ingestion should explicitly author it.
No automatic conversion reinterprets a recorded scenario as behavior. Source
semantics remain in embedded JSON 1; JSON 2 has source identity/digest, geometry
and presentation references. Architecture geometry uses pinned ELK; sequence
layout uses deterministic sequence code. Both rendering paths are deterministic.

This file intentionally duplicates internal documentation because it is the
external agent handoff. Maintainers: when changing a supported source contract,
reference rule, CLI option or render limitation, update this guide in the same
change. Keep the complete examples executable and independent of other source
files. Their marked JSON blocks are exercised by `test/agent-guide.test.mjs`
through validation, layout, rendering and recovery. That catches stale examples;
it is not proof that every prose sentence matches the code or that ingestion
works correctly on every real system.

## Cross-model maintenance with workspace lineage

For models and evidence in different repositories, folders, or hosted documents,
use an explicit [workspace manifest](docs/workspace.md). It records evidence and
elaboration links separately from collection navigation. Start with `workspace
check`, then `workspace affected` using the registered IDs of changed sources or
models. Treat results as potential review scope, preserve access gaps and user
authorization, and record evidence revisions and outcomes in an update report.
No command fetches remote sources, scans repositories, or decides which claims
are still accurate. See the workspace guide for the complete workflow.
